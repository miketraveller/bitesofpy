Bite 3. Word Values â˜†
Calculate the dictionary word that would have the most value in Scrabble.

There are 3 tasks to complete for this Bite:

First write a function to read in the dictionary.txt file (= DICTIONARY constant), returning a list of words (note that the words are separated by new lines).
Second write a function that receives a word and calculates its value. Use the scores stored in LETTER_SCORES. Letters that are not in LETTER_SCORES should be omitted (= get a 0 score).
With these two pieces in place, write a third function that takes a list of words and returns the word with the highest value.
Look at the TESTS tab to see what your code needs to pass. Enjoy!
