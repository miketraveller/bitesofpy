"""
In this Bite you learn how to lookup values 
from a dictionary or in Python: dict.

You are presented with workout_schedule with keys: 
days and values: workouts. Complete get_workout_motd that 
receives a day string, title case it so the function can 
receive case insensitive days, look it up in the dict and do two things:

If the day (key) is not in the dictionary, raise a KeyError,
we don't want this function to continue, the caller needs to 
catch this exception,
If the key is in the dictionary, return chill or go_train 
depending if it's a Rest day or not. The latter you will 
need to string-interpolate using format.
